Extension: Physics-Based Non-Rigid Registration (PBNRR)

Description: This Slicer extension non-rigid registers a moving to a fixed MRI using a linear homogeneous bio-mechanical model to compute a dense deformation field that defines a transformation for every point in the fixed to the moving image.
